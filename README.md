# Sort Algorithms
A collection of sort algorithms that you can apply to a .txt file of any length. Algorithms include insertion, bubble, selection, merge, quick, and heap sort. This will also provide the final sorted list, the number of comparisons and swaps made, and the total time taken. To use your own .txt files, change the file read by the FileReader (currently set to the included sortme100000.txt).

Also included is a random number file generator that will generate a text file with x random numbers, used for testing sorts.
